> [!TIP]
> Take a look at [Aikido Firewall](https://github.com/AikidoSec/firewall-node) if you are searching for a professional solution with less false positives, better performance and a web dashboard for monitoring your application.

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import easyWaf from 'easy-waf'; // CommonJS: require('easy-waf').default;
const app = express();

app.use(easyWaf());

app.listen(3000);
```

> [!WARNING]
> This software tries to defend many common attacks while keeping the rate of false positives low. There will always be methods to bypass this WAF. Therefore, using this package is not a reason to neglect security when developing an application. Always validate user input! This software should be used with caution and is more an educational tool than a professional security solution.

## Features

-   Restrict allowed HTTP methods and add your own ip black- and whitelist
-   Blocks requests from bad bots and fake crawlers
-   Blocks malicious requests:
    -   CRLF Injection
    -   Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)
    -   Directory / Path Traversal
    -   HTTP Parameter Pollution
    -   Open Redirect / Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (queryUrlWhitelist option must be set)
    -   Prototype Pollution
    -   SQL Injections and NoSQL Injections
-   Can block requests from the Tor network (disabled by default)
-   Compatible with many popular web frameworks and with the integrated Node.js HTTP server
-   Supports ES modules and CommonJS

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> I strongly recommend to activate the "dryMode" at the beginning to be able to identify possible false positives from the logs.
> If EasyWAF should parse bodies, bind a body-parser middleware to your app before adding EasyWAF.

```bash
npm i easy-waf
```

In the [examples](examples/) folder you can find samples of how to integrate EasyAF into your application.

If you run your Node.js app behind a reverse proxy, don't forget to set the `trustProxy` option.
To enable Open Redirect protection, configure the `queryUrlWhitelist` option.

## Configuration

EasyWAF is easy to use without the need for much configuration, but there are still many customization options.

```javascript
app.use(
    easyWaf({
        allowedHTTPMethods: ['GET', 'POST'],
        queryUrlWhitelist: ['github.com'],
        modules: {
            directoryTraversal: {
                enabled: true,
                excludePaths: /^\/exclude$/i,
            },
        },
    }),
);
```
